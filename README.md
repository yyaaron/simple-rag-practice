# simple-rag-practice
In order to learn RAG and implement it myself, I rewrote codes from Dianio's repo: https://github.com/mrdbourke/simple-local-rag, wrapping methods into classes. 
From which I suppose we could benefit from:
- Easier to re-read. As Dianio's purpose is to teach beginers to understand what RAG is and how to implement RAG step by step, he chose colab notebook as his blackboard. In my rewriting version, these steps are wrapped in each classes, and it's easier to read after you mastered RAG and want to re-read it one day.
- Simplicity. As a coder, I'd like to read code directly, rather read through the document again to get the idea. This can be done by reading main.py first to get a whole idea, and then read details from corresponding classes.

Anyhow, if it is the first time for you to study implementation of RAG, I strongly recomend you to read Dianio's notebook(https://colab.research.google.com/github/mrdbourke/simple-local-rag/blob/main/00-simple-local-rag.ipynb) first, and watch his youtube at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN_2fnOPY-M
